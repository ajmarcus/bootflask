Bootflask
=========

A combined boostrap + html5 boilerplate + flask + livereload starter template inspired by [flask-boilerplate](https://github.com/mjhea0/flask-boilerplate).

####Here's how to set it up:
1. Copy `app/config.tmpl` to `app/config.py`
2. Change the `SECRET_KEY` in the config file
3. Update the `author` and `description` metadata in `app/templates/base.html`
4. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Test that everything is working `./test`
6. Run the app with `./serve`
